Objective

Design and implement a Python-based fitness and health calculator that enables users to:

- Calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and identify health category (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, Obese)
- Compute Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on user input and established equations
- Recommend daily protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake using calorie needs and standard nutritional guidelines
- Deliver actionable health and fitness advice tailored to each user's BMI category

Motivation

By making these health metrics straightforward and accessible, this project aims to empower beginners, students, and everyday fitness enthusiasts to make smarter decisions about nutrition and physical activity—supporting better long-term health outcomes.

Scope

- Command-line interface for user data entry
- Covers adult males and females of varying age, weight, height, and activity level
- Outputs clear, actionable health reports including BMI, BMR, TDEE, macronutrient breakdown, and advice
